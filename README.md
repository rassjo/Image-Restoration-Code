# Image-Restoration-Code

THis is the code for Group 8:
- Isabel Moreno
- Rasmus Sjoo
- Joyce Cobussen
- Jerry Huang

The codes for Successive overrelaxation and Cahn-Hilliard is kept in separete files.

Speed_of_convergence_check inpaints the images and contains code to investigate the number of iterations necessary for convergence for each method.

The .zip file contains another code, Module_B_image_inpainting. This inpaints the image and contains a stop condition to find the exact number of iterations necessary for convergence. The zip folder also contains the best results of four different images and a text file containing the most important results. 

Cahn-Hilliard solves the Cahn-Hilliard equation to inpaint the image, using a Fourier transform to make the equation iteratively solvable.
